Recevied the data from the USGS which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.
Imported in the data through Json and visualized the data. 
Created circular data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
